usage:
./main [dir]

prog flow:
- opens 'top.mod'
- loads all modules and connections
- loop: updates clock, then keyboard then,
- evaluates starting from top module, depth first

syntax:
input [name]
output [name]
logic [name] [init value]
module [name] [filename] [input name] [param] [output name] [param] endmodule
nand [param] [param] [param]
keyboard [key] [param]
present [x] [y] [r] [g] [b] [param]
clock [param]
# this is a comment #

* A, B, C, D... map to keyboard keys
* keyboard can only be created in top module and there is only 1 (so that is not sampling keyboard at diff times)
* max dimensions are 0 to 255

- modules have to be defined after ports/parameters
+ check for module ins/logics->ins, outs/logics->outs 
- cannot repeat names
+ order matters
- check that all inputs and outputs in module instantiation are satisfied (cannot have unconnected ports)
+ check for end of comment and endmodule
+ check for cyclic module
- check if parameters have been created

parameter = input or output or logic
port = input or output
